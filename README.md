# Report-Maker
This automated reporting template was made to produce a report for a particular company representing a particular date range and broken down in a specific way. The final function in the notebook takes a daterange as input, breaks that date range down into weeks as defined by the company's accounting, and then queries the database and plots the data in the resulting data frame for each week within the date range. A finally summary for the whole date range is included at the end, and then a title page for the report is also produced. The entire report is then saved locally as a pdf.
